# Protoytype 

Prototype is an object associated with functions, objects, primitive data types etc, its a meadium through which we inherit properties and methods of other objects.
This is called prototypal inheritance. 

## .prototype 

- usually this property is associated with functions (not with objects if you do obj.prototype it will be `undefined`).
- When we create a function we do have toString, call, apply & bind methods avilable on instace object that is because in `Function constructor` these properties were added on prototype of it.
- the `.prototype` is explicitly used with function constructors
Note: In javascript we say everything is an object because all of the things(functions, objects) etc are inherited from Object and Object is inherited from `null` and 
it is the end of prototype chain. This is also one of the reason when we do `typeof null` it says `object` 

```js 
   function TataCars(owner) {
        this.owner = owner;
        this.printDetails = () => console.log(`The Tata Company is owned by ${this.owner}`)
    }
    TataCars.prototype.offeredCars = function () {
        console.log('Tiago, Nexon, Altroz')
    }
    const o = new TataCars('Ratan Tata')
    console.log(o.owner) // Ratan Tata
    o.printDetails() // The Tata Company is owned by Ratan Tata
    o.offeredCars() // Tiago, Nexon, Altroz

```
- The Arrays, primitive data type's parent classes (Number, String etc) are constructed from function constructor, that is why the pollyfills directly adds methods on prototype
of these constructors
- E.g I can add my custom method on Arrays 

```js

    Array.prototype.myReduce = function (cb, acc) {
        let index = 0;
        for (let num of this)
            acc = cb(acc, num, index)
        index++;
        return acc
    }

    const nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]
    const result = nums.myReduce((acc, val) => {
        console.log(val)
        return acc + val
    }, 0)
    console.log(result) // 100
```

## `__proto__`

- The `__proto__` is `prototype` property added on `Object` ie `Object.prototype.__proto__`  
- The `__proto__` exposes [[Prototype]] properties, which is a private object and allows us to modify it
- This feature is `Deprecated` its being removed from browsers and we should try to avoid using it.
- The modern alternative to using `__proto__` are `Object.getPrototypeOf()` & `Object.setPrototypeOf()`

Example to update the proto of an object

```js

    const obj = {
        name: 'abhilash',
        __proto__: {
            job: 'Software developer'   // way 1
        }
    }
    obj.__proto__.charecter = 'Awesome' // way 2
    console.log(obj.name, ' = ', obj.job, ' = ', obj.charecter) //abhilash  =  Software developer
```

Another example to set `null` in prototype of an object basically remove prototype object 

```js
 const obj1 = {
        name: 'abhilash',
        __proto__: null
    }
    console.log(obj1.toString())  // error as we removed the prototype object 
```

## `[[Prototype]] or <prototype>`

- Its just a notation through which browser's represents the prototype of an object, its intenal proerty and its also private we can not directly change it by doing something like
`obj[[Prototype]]`  
- The Chrome console, edge uses [[Prototype]] to denote the object's prototype, following the spec's terms; Firefox uses `<prototype>`.

## inheritance

- Javascript implements inheritace by using object's, each object has internal link to another object, this linking object is basically called as prototype object 
(accessed using .prototype or .__proto__ etc)
- The prototype object may have link to another object, and this object prototype have link to another(e.g obj.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__)...and so on until it reaches to `null` 
- This is called prototype chain.
- By definition null has no prototype and acts as final link in prototype chain.


## Object inheritace

### Way 1 using __proto__
```js

const car = {
        parent: 'Tata',
    }
    const cars = {
        cars: 'Tiago, Punch, Nexon'
    }
    cars.__proto__ = car;

    console.log(cars.parent) // Tata
    console.log(cars.cars) // Tiago, Punch, Nexon
```

### Way 2 using Object.setPrototypeOf 

This the recommended way rather than using __proto__ but changing prototype even using this method is slow and can cause performance degradation

```js
 const car = {
        parent: 'Tata',
    }
    const childCars = {
        cars: 'Tiago, Punch, Nexon',
        message: function () { console.log(`The ${this.cars} are from ${this.parent}`) }
    }
    Object.setPrototypeOf(childCars, car) 
     console.log(childCars.parent) // Tata
    childCars.message() // The Tiago, Punch, Nexon are from Tata
```

### Way 3 using Object.create


```js
    const car = {
        parent: 'Tata',
    }

    const childCars = Object.create(car);
    childCars.cars = 'Tiago, Punch, Nexon';

    console.log(car.parent, ' = ', childCars.cars) //Tata  =  Tiago, Punch, Nexon
```

Below is the Most recommended way, i.e to create a new object by setting its prototype and then adding properties on it

```js
   const parent = {
        name: 'Tata'
    }
    const newObject = Object.create(parent);
    newObject.cars = 'Tiago, Punch, Nexon'
    console.log(`The ${newObject.name} cars are ${newObject.cars}`) // The Tata cars are Tiago, Punch, Nexon
```

## Function constructor inheritance 

```js
   function CarCompany(name) {
        this.parentCompany = name;
        this.printCarCompany = () => console.log(this.parentCompany)
    }

    CarCompany.prototype.OtherCompanies = function () {
        console.log('Hyundai, Mahindra, Maruti')
    }

    function Cars(parentCompanyName, ...rest) {
        CarCompany.call(this, parentCompanyName); // most important line for inheritance
        this.cars = rest;
        this.printCars = function () {
            console.log(`The ${this.parentCompany} offers ${this.cars.join(', ')}`)
        }
    }

    const carsObj = new Cars('Tata', 'Tiago', 'Punch', 'Nexon');
    carsObj.printCarCompany(); // Tata
    carsObj.printCars(); // The Tata offers Tiago, Punch, Nexon
    carsObj.OtherCompanies() // Note that: the prototype methods are not inherited in this way, so this line will throw an error

    /**
     * If you want to use prototype of Parent i.e CarCompany you will have to do following thing 
     * Cars.prototype = CarCompany.prototype
     * note that because this is function you cant use Object.setPrototypeOf or Object.create methods
    */
