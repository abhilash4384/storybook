# What is web worker?
Web worker API allows us to run javascript code in background i.e on seprate thread(worker thread) rather than main thread. 
A worker is an object created using a constructor (e.g. Worker()) that runs a named JavaScript file, this file contains the code that needs to be run in background. 
So these 2 seperate file scripts communicate with each other by using `postMessage()` method and respond via `onmessage` even handler.
The data passed to worker is copied not transferred i.e a clone of object/variable is created using `structuredClone()`
There are 2 types of Worker 
1. Dedicated Worker (const worker = new Worker("worker.js"))
2. Shared Worker (const worker = new SharedWorker("worker.js"))
Workers can call other workers.

Note: Web workders can not interact with DOM, but they can do a lot of other things like api calling, accessing indexedDB, websockets etc


# Terminating Worker
we can also terminate worker using `workerInstace.terminate()` method (in the main script)

# Dedicated Worker Example:
Standard workers utilized by a single script, the below example runs a heavy task on worker thread and main thread is free to do whatever it wants.

```html

        <body>
            <button onclick="sumOfNums()">CPU intensive calculation</button>
            <button onclick="changeBackgound()">Change Background</button>
        </body>
        <script>
            var worker = new Worker("./worker.js");;

            function sumOfNums() {
                if (worker) {
                    worker.postMessage("INIT_CALCULATIONS")
                }
            }

            worker.onmessage = function (message) {
                console.log('Message from worker = ', message.data)
            }

            function changeBackgound() {
                if (document.body.style.backgroundColor === "yellow") {
                    document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red"
                } else {
                    document.body.style.backgroundColor = "yellow"
                }
            }
        </script>
</html>

```

The worker file
```js
self.onmessage = async function (message) {
	console.log('Message in worker = ', message);
	if (message.data === 'INIT_CALCULATIONS') {
		let sum = 0;
		for (let i = 0; i <= 9007199254; i++) sum += i;

		// we can also call api's
		const fetchData = await fetch(
			'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/'
		);
		const apiData = await fetchData.json();

		self.postMessage({ sum, apiData });
	}
};

```
# Shared Worker

A shared worker is accessible by multiple scripts â€” even if they are being accessed by different windows, iframes or even workers.
Unlike dedicated webworker shared web worker work on `port` so to send a message `sharedWorker.port.postMessage()` to respond the worker uses 
`onconeect` event. This can be useful when we want to communicate one window to other and vice-versa usin shared worker as a mediator.
