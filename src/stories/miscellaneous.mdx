# git ssh setup
I have tried it in windows, use powershell as admin in windows
- ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -C "windows-ssh@mcnz.com"
In place of `windows-ssh@mcnz.com` we can have any string but usually it should be email
- once this command is fired powershell asks for the file name, usually all git provider look for id_rsa file 
by default but doing so will remove existing git ssh key so to support multiple git providers like github, gitlab
create different ssh files, you can give any name to file not needed to preppend with id_ 
- The main thing to note here is that the we have to copy the filename.pub containts and paste(configure)
on git providers
- Next update the config file usually all pub files, ssh files are in `~/.ssh` directory i.e users/user name/ .ssh 
- in config file add below lines 
```
Host gitlab.com
HostName gitlab.com
User git
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab2
IdentitiesOnly yes

```
- update the provider in place of host and hostname also update the identity file with the newly created file name
- lastly to test the the setup fire `ssh -T git@gitlab.com`, if everything was setup correctly it will greet you.

# How to freeze a hover/focus element e.g like dropdown or tooltip?

# Performance tab chrome:
- Start it with record button

# Searching for a specefic style(.class or id) file

- other way: `ctrl + p` search `screenshot`

# fetchpriority attribute for images
- high| low | auto 
- auto is default one here
- useful in the cases of carosul where user sees the 1st image initially so rest of the images can have `low` 
fetch priority and the first one should be `high`
- similarly a long scrolling page: the top once should have `high` priority and `low` to bottom
- this attribute can also be applied on scripts and style tags

# HTML vs DOM?
Html represents initial page content and DOM represents current page content i.e javascript or css
can modify the contantets of htm once loaded which whill not be happening in the actual html but in the DOM

# Snippets trick:
- Write some scripts that you want to run and whenever you want to run it simply `ctrl+p` and use `>` name of 
the snippet file will bring you to that snippet
- if you directly want to exicute it `!` file name
