# What is decorators?
- decorators allows us to modify class or methods, property or parameter behaviour. 
- it was heavily used in angular like @Component @Module etc
- Althought its proposed for javascript but it is still not avilable in JS 
- If we want to use it we need to either use typescript or use babel with JS 
- Note that it only works with class based things

```typescript
// @experimentalDecorators
function first() {
  console.log("first(): factory evaluated");
  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    // target: here target is the class 
    // propertyKey: is the name of the peroperty on which decorator is used
    console.log("first(): called");
  };
}

class ExampleClass {
  @first()
  method() {}
}
```

output should be: 
first(): factory evaluated
first(): called
