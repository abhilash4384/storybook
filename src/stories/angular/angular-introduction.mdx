# What does ng stands for in angular ?
- next generation

# Angular History:
- The AngularJS (1.x versions) came into picture in year 2010, 
It was a bit complicated it used to have elements like controller, $scope, watch, apply etc
- It was developed by Google
- All the angular 2.x and above versions are called as Angular insted of AngularJS, 
these versions are drastically different from 1.x versions (for which google also has to face lot of backlash)
- angular is heavily based on dependency injections, decorators, 2 way data binding
- angular is a full-fledged framework that ships with modules such as routing, reactive forms, testing libraries,
compiler etc

# Angular packages:
Below are the packages that came up with angular framework by default (v.18)
- **@angular/common**: Exports all the basic Angular directives and pipes, such as NgIf, NgForOf, DecimalPipe, and so on.
- **@angular/compiler**: Also know as `ngc` 
- **@angular/core**: Contains angulars core fuctionality things like pipes, life cycle methods and much more
- **@angular/forms**: supports modules for 2 different approaches - reactive forms, template drive forms
- **@angular/platform-browser-dynamic**: Supports JIT compilation on supported browsers
- **zone.js**: From what I understood: we run the code snippets in zones where the sync code will be batched , 
a zone means time tracker that starts at the beigning of the code and end at the end of the code. 
The zone js tracks all this timers where they have exicuted and who called them etc. 
In a nutshell zone js is a automated timer that helps angular to know when certain task has finished and then 
angular can update the view.

Although this was used from angular 2.x and above, angular is trying to get rid of zone.js(zoneless) from version 17 and 
it is still in experimental phase. As an alternative angular is pushing `sgnals`.  
- **rxjs, tslib, @angular/animations, @angular/platform-browser, @angular/router, zone.js**
- apart from this there are dev dependencies like `jasmine, karma, typescript, @angular/cli...`

# What is Zone.js:
Note: `This is entirely from what I understood maybe im completly wrong`
- Suppose that if we are running a function which consists of some sync code statements then some 
async code statements then again some sync code statements. 
- What zone js will do is run 1st sync code code statement in one zone, next async code statemnts in 2nd zone, 
the last sync code statments in 3rd zone. 
- Now a zone means we are starting a timer at the start of the zone and ending it at the end of the zone statements.
- All of these zones are hanled by a single parent module so it can track when which zone has completed.
- Now the important part is not about timer but when certain zone has completed working. 
- Angular uses this zonejs to know when to make changes in component tree its kind of like a `forceRender` in react
- The reason for this is angular uses normal class members to maintain changes whenever they change angular should
know something has changed and that can be used in html view so to make those changes zonejs helps angular.

# What are zoneless angular?
- So as we know angular uses zone.js to detect changes and to render them the problem is it is a slow, hard to debug
process 
- so angular is trying to get rid of zone which angular also call zoneless js
- now to detect changes or `forceRender` angular is favouring `signals`
- Angular still ships with `zone.js` but it can not completly get rid of zone.js as there are thousands of 
apps running on zone.js and they cant be migrated directly to newer versions so to keep up supporting 
existing apps zone js still comes along with angular framework
- but for newer apps better to go with signals


# Essentials:
[attribute]: use this on any dom element to make the dom property refer to component variable and do not treat 
as string
{{expression}}: here we can write expressions like 1+1 or refer to a variable (sometimes for an attribute we can 
also use this insted of above one but the above one [attribute] is recommended)
*ngFor: loop over array
- Input(): decorator is used to pass data from parent to child (similar to props in react)
- services: a service is a ts class in angular which can be injected to a component using dependency injection. 
To make a service DI in component we have to use `@Injectable` decorator on service class
Note: to make most of the essentials work your component should have imported `CommonModule` 

# Crazy shit:
- usually angular components are appended with `.component.ts` this is just a naming convention and not necessary
- The component class Name need not have to start with capital letter


# NgModule: 
- If we are using `standalone` components by setting it to `true` in app component directive then we do not need 
@NgModule
- By default in v17 and above supports `standalone` components so we will not see @NgModule but we can use it 
by configuring `--no-standalone` flag while generating components
- It was used to create seprate modules of our project
usual syntax

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, ], // privatly avilable to the module, these are typically components or pipes 
  imports: [BrowserModule], // import other modules 
  providers: [], // things which want to inject via Dependancy injection like services
  bootstrap: [AppComponent], // starting point of app 
  exports: [] // publicly avialble to other modules, these are typically components or pipes
})
```
- It was helpful remove the clutter in the file
- The modules which exports all of their components are usually called `shared modules` basically they should 
have same components in declarations and exports. common examples are social media icons, loading spinners, modals
etc 
- `core module` or `service module`: No declarations only services are their in `providers` array of NgModule

# httpModule vs fetch
- its not mandatory to use httpModule for api calls but more complex apps it is suitable
- we can use fetch api if we need

# react equivivalnt terms (react term vs angular)
- ref vs #var on DOM
- {} vs {{}}
-  useParams() vs this.route.snapshot.params
- && vs *ngIf
- .map vs *ngFor
- formik/react hook forms vs ReactiveFormsModule/TemplateDriveForms
