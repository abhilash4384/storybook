# What happens if we use normal (let) variable to handle the state in functional component?
- Changes made into normal variable will be lost in re-render so we will not be getting updated values
- Changing normal variable will not cause re-render 
- In below example the if you see after clicking handleClick() the value of Log 1 will still be 0 no matter what
- however The value inside handleClic's console.log will be updated one, this might be due to handleClick forms a closure

```jsx


export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;

  console.log('Log 1 = ', index)
  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
    console.log('Log 2 = ', index);
  }
  ...
}
```
# useRef: 
- useRef hook returns us a mutable object which is having only one property as `current`
- we can directly change this `current` property and it will not cause the rerendering to happen (may be because memory address is not changed)
- in the let variable example if you replace it with useRef object then it will work as expected only thing is rerendering will not happen
