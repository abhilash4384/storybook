# Mixins Patterns

A mixin is an object that we can use in order to add reusable functionality to another object or class, without using inheritance. We canâ€™t use mixins on their own: their sole purpose is to add functionality to objects or classes without inheritance.
An practical real world example of mixin could be `scss` mixins (we use it @include mixin-name). I can also in react the we can consider common components as mixins like input, button etc

# Advantages

A great benifit that i can think of is in unit testing individual pieces of code.
