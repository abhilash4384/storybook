# What is AGILE methopology?
AGILE is iterative approach for sw development that builds softwaer incrementally within a fixed timeline.  

Typical iteration follows below approach:
Requirement -> Design -> Develop -> Test -> Deploy -> Review 

There are many frameworks fall under AGILE methodology - Scrum, Kanban are the two popular once


# What is sprint?
When we bound AGILE methodology specially scrum with time this process is called as SPRINT. 
Usually it follows a 2 week cycle where in the end we give deliverables to the customer. 
This process is also calles as SPRINT.


# What is SCRUM?
Its an AGILE team collaboration framework.
Scrum consists of - Sprint, Team, Deliverables, Continuous feedback from customer

# What is SCRUM team?
1. Product Owner: accountable for work which team is supposed to complete. They also manage business and market
requirements.
2. Scrum Master: Responsible for helping team members flollow scrum rules, like organizing meeting for team, 
dealing with challenges
3. Development Team: Develop product.

# Scrum artifacts:
- Product backlog: ordered list of tasks and requirement the final product needs, its never 
complete and constantly keeps evolving
- Sprint backlog: list of items need to worked during a sprint
- Burndown Charts: A graphical representation of amount of estimated remaining work.
- Product Increments: sum of completed work during sprint with previously completed **all** sprints work

# How does scrum process works?
- Product owner gets the requirement, creates the product backlog for final product along with priority of the work.
- Next product owner and team get together for **SPRINT PLANNING**, here we decided sprint backlog
- While development team starts on working the product they get together every day to discuss the development and issus
, this meeting is usually called as **Daily Scrum Meeting**. It is overseen by the scrum master. Ideal time should be 15 mins.
- At the end of sprint, **sprint review** or **sprint demo** meeting is organised by product owner, here the development team 
demonstrates what they have completed.
- Lastly there will be a **sprint retrospective** meeting for the development team, here the team discusses what is good 
in this sprint and what is not.
- After that this cycle again beings unless budget is exhausted or product is completed.

# Scrum Board:
It could be piece of software like jira or board or anything
usually contains columns like TODO, Inprogress, QA, Done
