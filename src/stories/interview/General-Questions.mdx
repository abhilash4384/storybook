# How web browser works?
- Web browser consists of some programs usually we call them API and it understands HTML, CSS & JS. 
Whenever we search for some URL the Request first goes to domain name server(DNS) which is like a telephone dictionary 
where the IP address of websistes is stored against the URL name. (We can also directly put the ip address in the browser.)
The request then get resolved at DNS server and forwareded to the correct server machine via the ip address. The server then
sends us the request back that may be in the form of html css js etc. Which then finally be rendred on the browser.

# What is SSL?
SSL stands for secure socket layer. It is a certificate that is either given by third party vendors like 
`lets encrypt, digi cert` etc or we can create our own certificate on local machine. 
The purpose of the ssl is to encrypt the request & response i.e communication between client and server.
The SSL certificate consists of public key (which was sent by the server for the to encrypt request), 
SSL issuer public key ie 2 pulic keys for client and the private key at the server end to decrypt the request.
The HTTPS protocol requires data to be encrypted so in that case SSL is heavily used. 

# What is load balancer?
Load balancer can a piece of software or hardware that manages request and increase or decrease numnber of 
servers as needed. It can be implemented with different algorithms like round robin, first come first serve etc


# Why should we hire you?
I belive I have suitable combination of skills for this job role as I do have knowledge of react, react-native.
along with it I do have some exposure to angular and nodejs. Also Im flexible enough to understand IT industry dynamics
and adapt to change accordingly like I may have to learn new skill depending upon the client requirement.
I have fare amount of experience to do the justice for this role.
I also have proven track record of succssfully completing the projects. 


# Tell us about a time you have failed?

I was new in Talespin project and I found out there are somethings which can be improved like prettier, githooks 
etc. To implement this I needed to have a talk with team and get it discussed but I did not do so thinking in my 
mind that what other people in my team think of me like oh he is trying to be oversmart and what not. Eventually 
as I spend time with team I found out that they are nice people and so finally I conduced the meeting to point out 
the things but I could have conduced the meeting 2 weeks earlier which could have improved overall product quality.
That was also the time I have decided that no matter what I should openly discuss my ideas.


# How do you handle conflict between your team members?
- Rather than leaving things as is I would rather encourage team members to talk through this on their owner
if still didnt get resolved I will step in to get it resolved for them. 
There was a time when 2 of good dvelopers constantly compete with each other and started passing commenting, taunting
on each other and both of them used to work on same module. Seeing this I asked my manager to let one of the developers 
assist me in my module and another one to continue. This turned out to be the great solution as eventually the 
issue not only got resolved but they also started respectig each other. 


# What are your stengths?
- I think collaborative nature is my biggest strength. When it comes to work Im mostly cofertable with people
around me. I always try to help anyone who requires my help. 
- Apart from this the other strength could be my calmness: I try to remain as calm as possible, it specially 
helps me in moment of some panic situations. 
- The other strenght could be curiosity. As i have curios nature to find out how things works, my curiosity is 
specially applicable in two cases one for my work which is programming and the other for machines like car/bike etc

# What are your weakness?
- My biggest weakness could be my helping nature when it comes to work. I found it really difficult to say no. 
- Procastination will be antoher one specially due to mobile.

# Do you have experience of leading team? 
- To be honest if you look from the managerial stand point like scrum master no but if your asking from 
developers point of view then yes. Being a senior member in team In my previous project I was responsible for
deciding the folder structure, project configuration, code standards and all sort of things. There were 2 main 
modules of the system Flow and Unity player. Im responsible for the entire flow module and we are 4 people 
working on it.

- I also occasionaly enjoy going for swimming, I try to do it at least once a month unless its rainy season.
- I do enjoy travelling a lot, going to some unique places which I have visited
- I also like to go on long rides wheter its bike/car. The only thing is I am the one driving it.

# What is your goal? 
- I know that I should say somehting smart like being on most senior position of this company or manager something else. 
But I genuinally feel that first I should gather enough know and then decide because the IT industry dynamics is 
continously changing, sometime back everyone was talking about cloud now AI, machine learning. Still I do want 
to contribute something in the field of AI that would make a difference for people.    

# Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
- I would be learning something in the filed of AI could be LLM related thing. I feel I would be contributing something in the field of AI. Im not sure what but may be on a senior level
handling an AI based project or something.

# How do you handle toxic environment?
- I would prefer to avoid office gossips or talking on any controversial topics like religion, politics etc.
- Ill try to stay positive, usually I know that no one is too bad or too right its the matter of perception how we see it 
- Prioratized work over other things.
- In case of unbearable situation ill change the project.
