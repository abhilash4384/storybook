# How to handle light and dark mode in CSS?
- There are multiple ways to do this using css variables, one way to do this is using 
`@media(prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
```css
```  
# :is, :where, :has 

- the psudo selector `is & where` works similar to each other the only difference is `is` has highest specifity 
of the included elements where as `where` does not have any specificity basically it makes 0 specificity

- The purpose of these psudo selector is to avoid writing repetion for the different clases 

```CSS

/*  

div p, div span {
color: green
}
is equivivalant to below code
*/

div :is(p, span) {  /* sepcificity 0-0-2*/
    color: green   
}
/* or if you dont want specificity */


div :where(p, span) {  /* sepcificity 0-0-1*/
    color: green   
}

```

Note: One thing to note here is that: to decide specificity inside `is` 
the highest specificty element is considered i.e even if there are multiple classes and one id selector 
the specificity becomes 1-0-0 event for classes

- The `has` is completly different on the other hand: `has` psudo selector is a parent selector 
- ref below example: if a `div` is having `p` tag then it selects those div so the background color 
gets applied to div who is having paragraph tag in them
i.e 
```CSS
  div:has(p) {  
            background: green;
        }
```

# What if any one of the CSS selector invalid or something breaks the css for a selector?
- browsers skips the definition for that selector and moves on

# First child selector
```css
li:first-child {
    color: green
}
```
- similarly `:last-child` 

# :focus vs :focus-within
- :focus-within is a parent selector of the focused element

# :not 
```css
p:not(.irrelevant) {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
- paragraphs that do not have `.irrelevant` class

# even | odd selector and more

```CSS

li:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: lightyellow;
}

li:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: green;
}

/*till 3rd element ie first 3 elements */

li:nth-child(-n+3) {
    background: pink
}

/*Select  3rd element onwards */

li:nth-child(n+3) {
    background: red
}

/*Select every 3rd element ie 3, 6, 9...the element*/

li:nth-child(3n){
    background: black
}
```
- Similar to this to select the elements in reverse order (or bottom) use `:nth-last-child` selector

# :root

- it selects the root element in a dom tree (need to check in react if it selects 
root of a component for moduler css) time being consider it is pointing to `html` tag, the only reason to use
this is its specificity is higher than `html` selector 

# CSS classes are case sensitive

# Outline vs Border?
Below are the differences between both of them but one most important thing to remember is that
the  `box-sizing: border-box`
