# How to run non-expo app on devices 
- after setting up adb drivers `npm run android` for android
- for ios we need macos and after setting up xcode we need to run the device from xcode by opening our project
Note: for ios we also need apple developer account and complete the code signing process
- some other ways `npx react-native run-ios` 

# incall platform specefic dependencies
- `npx pod-install ios`

# How to use expo
- If our project created using `expo` start the development server using `npx expo start` (supports both ios/android) then scan the barcode on your app by downloading expo app

# How to build app for production (non expo)
- For ios `npm run ios -- --mode="Release"` and submit the app to appstore for review (.ipa file)
- For android we need to use `keytool` command we will also need keystore file
`keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`
 we will also need gradle variables in .gradle.properties file and need to more changes in gradle file like providing signing key password, keystore file name etc
 `npx react-native build-android --mode=release`
- in expo app.json is the configuration file

# React vs React Native elements
- Normal css files vs StyleSheet.creat({}) 
- React Native is based on Flex layour (grid not supported)
- className vs style
- div vs View, KeyboardAvoidingView(in case of forms we use it)
- img vs Image `<Image source={require('./my-icon.png')} />; or <Image  source={{uri: 'app_icon'}} style={{width: 40, height: 40}} />`
- span vs Text (its a inline block element)
- div with background vs ImageBackground 
- button vs `TouchableOpacity`
- react-router-dom vs `@react-navigation`
- input vs TextInput
- list(ul) vs ScrollView or FlatList (prefer FlatList as it is more optimized)
- custom loader vs ActivityIndicator
- alert, confirm vs Alert, Modal
- React native supports ref's


Additional Components in ReactNative
- StatusBar, Switch(toggle), 

Missing In ReactNative
- Portal, svg, canvas, form, table

Alternatives: 
- Form: we can use plugins such as Formik, react hook form etc
